Majority of the datasets have missing values, that might be because the data collected were not at regular intervals or the breakdown of instruments and so on. 
It is nearly impossible to build the proper model or in other words, get accurate results. 
The common techniques are either removing those records completely or substitute those missing values with the logical ones, there are various techniques to treat these types of problems.
e.g. Imputation
Example:	Prepare the dataset using various techniques to solve the problem, explore all the techniques available and use them to see which gives the best result.

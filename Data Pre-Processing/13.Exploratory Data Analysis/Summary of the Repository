Examples on EDA

Example 1. Calculate Skewness, Kurtosis using R/Python code & draw inferences on the following data.
           Hint: [Insights drawn from the data such as data is normally distributed/not, outliers, measures like mean, median, mode, variance, std. deviation]
            a.   Cars speed and distance
            
            b.   Top Speed (SP) and Weight (WT)

              2. EDA_Example_1b.csv
           c. Inferences on word file : 
               1. Example 1.a.docx
               2. Example 1.b.docx
               
Example 2. Histogram & Boxplot inferemces in Chick_weight_histogram_boxplot_inferences.docx

Example 3. Below are the scores obtained by a student in tests 
                  34,36,36,38,38,39,39,40,40,41,41,41,41,42,42,45,49,56
           1) Find mean, median, variance, standard deviation.
           2) What can we say about the student marks? [Hint: Looking at the various measures calculated above whether the data is normal/skewed or if outliers are present].  
Solution 1) Please refer the file Example_EDA_Q3.py file too.
           a. Mean : 41.0
	b. Median: 40.5 
           c. Mode : 41
           d. Variance : 25.53
           e. Standard Deviation : 5.05

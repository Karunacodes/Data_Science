Examples on EDA

Example 1. Calculate Skewness, Kurtosis using R/Python code & draw inferences on the following data.
           Hint: [Insights drawn from the data such as data is normally distributed/not, outliers, measures like mean, median, mode, variance, std. deviation]
            a.   Cars speed and distance
            
            b.   Top Speed (SP) and Weight (WT)
	    
Example 2. Draw inferences from Histogram & Boxplot :  inferences are saved on Chick_weight_histogram_boxplot_inferences.docx


Example 3. Below are the scores obtained by a student in tests 
                  34,36,36,38,38,39,39,40,40,41,41,41,41,42,42,45,49,56
           
	   1) Find mean, median, variance, standard deviation.
           Solution: Please refer the file Example_EDA_Q3.py file too.
           a. Mean : 41.0
	   b. Median: 40.5 
           c. Mode : 41
           d. Variance : 25.53
           e. Standard Deviation : 5.05
	   
	 2) What can we say about the student marks? [Hint: Looking at the various measures calculated above whether the data is normal/skewed or if outliers are present].
	 Solution: The data is not normally distributed, it is positively skewed (here mean > median) and has outliers. Because the distribution is skewed, median describes the central  tendency better.
	 
Example 4. 1) What is the nature of skewness when mean, median of data is equal?
	  Solution: Skewness is zero when mean and median are equal, and data is normally distributed.
	  
	  2) What is the nature of skewness when mean > median?
	 Solution: Skewness is positive when mean is more than median.
	 
	 3) What is the nature of skewness when median > mean?
	 Solution: Skewness is negative when median is more than mean.
	 
	 4) What does positive kurtosis value indicates for a data?
	Solution: Positive kurtosis means less data values are located near the mean and more data values are located on the tails, 
		  it implies that the peaks are sharp and tails are heavy, also known as leptokurtic.
	
	5) What does negative kurtosis value indicates for a data?
	Solution: Negative Kurtosis means more data values are located near the means and less data values are located on the tails.
		  It is also called platykurtic and implies that the peak is flat and tails are thin.


Example 5. Refer Example 5_ Boxplot.docx file.
	1) What can we say about the distribution of the data?
	Solution: The data is not normally distributed. The median is towards the right side of the box indicating most of the 
		  distribution on this side only and there is a outlier on left side. Left whisker of the box plot is longer too.
		  
	2)What is nature of skewness of the data?
	Solution: The skewness is on the left side.
	
	3)What will be the IQR of the data (approximately)? 
	solution: IQR = Q3 – Q1 = 18 – 10 = 8

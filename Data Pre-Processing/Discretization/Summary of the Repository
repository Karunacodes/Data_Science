Everything will revolve around the data in Analytics world.
Proper data will help you to make useful predictions which improve your business.
Sometimes the usage of original data as it is does not help to have accurate solutions.
It is needed to convert the data from one form to another form to have better predictions.
We need to explore on various techniques to transform the data for better model performance.

Example : 1)	Convert the continuous data into discrete classes on iris dataset.
              Prepare the dataset by performing the preprocessing techniques, to have the data which improve model performance.

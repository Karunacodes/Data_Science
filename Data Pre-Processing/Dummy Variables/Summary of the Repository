Data is one of the most important assets. It is often common that data is stored in distinct systems with different formats and forms.
Non-numeric form of data makes it tricky while developing mathematical equations for prediction models.
We have the preprocessing techniques to make the data convert to numeric form. 


Example:	Prepare the dataset by performing the preprocessing techniques, to have the all the features in numeric format.
Solution : csv file "animal_category_numeric.csv" has been created with numeric data.

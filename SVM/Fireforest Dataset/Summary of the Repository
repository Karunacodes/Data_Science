Problem Statement : A construction firm wants to develop a suburban locality with new infrastructure but they might incur losses if they cannot sell the properties.
                    To overcome this, they consult an analytics firm to get insights on how densely the area is populated and the income levels of residents.
                    Use the Support Vector Machines algorithm on the given dataset and draw out insights and also comment on the viability of investing in that area.
                    
Business Objective : To predict and assess the profitability in investing in a locality.

Constraints : There can be many more factors which can influence the valuation of a locality e.g. government rules & regulations, commercial development of the area,
               amenities & infrastructure of the area.

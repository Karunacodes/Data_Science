Problem Statement : A certain organization wants an early estimate of their employee churn out rate. 
                    So the HR department gathered the data regarding the employeeâ€™s salary hike and the churn out rate in a financial year. 
                    The analytics team will have to perform an analysis and predict an estimate of employee churn based on the salary hike.
                    Build a Simple Linear Regression model with churn out rate as the target variable. 
                    Apply necessary transformations and record the RMSE and correlation coefficient values for different models.
                    
                    
Solution :  Business Objective : To perform an analysis and predict an estimate of employee churn based on the salary hike.

            Constraints : Churning out can be the result of many factors e.g. non-cordial work environment, work pressure, growth issues, better prospects etc.

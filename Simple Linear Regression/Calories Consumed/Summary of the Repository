Problem statement: A certain food-based company conducted a survey with the help of a fitness company to find the relationship between a personâ€™s weight gain 
                   and the number of calories they consumed in order to come up with diet plans for these individuals. Build a Simple Linear Regression model 
                   with calories consumed as the target variable. Apply necessary transformations and record the RMSE and correlation coefficient values for 
                   different models. 

This Repository consists of following files :
1. Calories_Consumed_SLR.py with python code

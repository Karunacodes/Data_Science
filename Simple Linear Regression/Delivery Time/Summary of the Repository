Problem  Statement : A logistics company recorded the time taken for delivery and the time taken for the sorting of the items for delivery. 
                     Build a Simple Linear Regression model to find the relationship between delivery time and sorting time with delivery time as the target variable.
                     Apply necessary transformations and record the RMSE and correlation coefficient values for different models

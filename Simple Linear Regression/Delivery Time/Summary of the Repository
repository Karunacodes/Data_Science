Problem  Statement : A logistics company recorded the time taken for delivery and the time taken for the sorting of the items for delivery. 
                     Build a Simple Linear Regression model to find the relationship between delivery time and sorting time with delivery time as the target variable.
                     Apply necessary transformations and record the RMSE and correlation coefficient values for different models.
                     
                     
Solution : Business Objective : To find the relationship between delivery time and sorting time

          Constraints  : The Delivery time & sorting time would vary for every product, planning and training for both of the parameters can help 
                          reduce the barriers in achieving economies in both.

Example : Please write Python Programs for all the problems .

          1.	 Take a variable ‘age’ which is of positive value and check the following:
            a.	If age is less than 10, print “Children”.
            b.	If age is more than 60 , print ‘senior citizens’

          2.	Find  the final train ticket price with the following conditions. 
            a.	If male and sr.citizen, 70% of fare is applicable
            b.	If female and sr.citizen, 50% of fare is applicable.
            c.	If female and normal citizen, 70% of fare is applicable
            d.	If male and normal citizen, 100% of fare is applicable
             [Hint: First check for the gender, then calculate the fare based on age factor.. For both Male and Female ,consider them as sr.citizens if their age >=60]

         3.	Check whether the given number is positive and divisible by 5 or not.

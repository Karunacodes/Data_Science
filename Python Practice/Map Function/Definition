In Python map() is a built-in function that allows you to process and transform all the items in an iterable without using an explicit for loop,
a technique commonly known as mapping. Map() is useful when you need to apply a transformation function to each item in an iterable and transform 
them into a new iterable. map() is one of the tools that support a functional programming style in Python.

1.	A) list1=[1,5.5,(10+20j),’data science’].. Print default functions and parameters exists in list1.
    B) How do we create a sequence of numbers in Python.
    C)  Read the input from keyboard and print a sequence of numbers up to that number

2.	Create 2 lists.. one list contains 10 numbers (list1=[0,1,2,3....9]) and other 
    list contains words of those 10 numbers (list2=['zero','one','two',.... ,'nine']).
    Create a dictionary such that list2 are keys and list 1 are values..

3.	Consider a list1 [3,4,5,6,7,8]. Create a new list2 such that Add 10 to the even number and multiply with 5 if it is odd number in the list1..

4.  Write a simple user defined function that greets a person in such a way that :
             i) It should accept both name of person and message you want to deliver.
              ii) If no message is provided, it should greet a default message ‘How are you’

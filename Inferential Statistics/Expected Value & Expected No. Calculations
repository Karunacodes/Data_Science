Example 1.Calculate Expected Value for the problem below
          The weights (X) of patients at a clinic (in pounds), are
          108, 110, 123, 134, 135, 145, 167, 187, 199
          Assume one of the patients is chosen at random. What is the Expected Value of the Weight of that patient?
        
Solution: Total weight: 108 + 110 + 123 + 134 + 135 + 145 + 167 + 187 + 199 = 1308
          Total no. of values/ outcomes = 9
          Assume one patient is chosen at random =1/9
          Expected Value = ∑X/n= 1308 /9 = 145.33333 ≈ 145
          
          
Example 2.Calculate the Expected number of candies for a randomly selected child:
          Below are the probabilities of count of candies for children (ignoring the nature of the child-Generalized view)
          i. Child A – probability of having 1 candy is 0.015
          ii. Child B – probability of having 4 candies is 0.20


            CHILD             Candies count         Probability
              A                     1                  0.015
              B                     4                  0.20
              C                     3                  0.65
              D                     5                  0.005
              E                     6                  0.01
              F                     2                  0.12


Solution: Expected number of candies for the randomly selected child
          =(1*0.015) + (4*0.20) + (3*0.65) + (5*0.005) + (6*0.01) + (2*0.120) =3.225

Example 1 : A glass manufacturing plant uses different earth elements to design new glass materials based on customer requirements.
            For which, they would like to automate the process of classification as itâ€™s a tedious job to manually classify them.
            Help the company achieve its objective by correctly classifying the glass type based on the other features using KNN algorithm.
            
Solution :  Business Objective : To classify the Glass type based on various material used in manufacturing the glass.

            Constraints : Correctness of the amounts in the contents is necessary to avoid misclassification of the type of glass.
